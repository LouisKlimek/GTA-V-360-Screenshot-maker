* [Microsoft ICE](https://www.heise.de/download/product/image-composite-editor-ice-58832/download) (Use the second or third mirror from this link because the offical download on Microsoft's Website is currently broken)

### Installation

3. While in-game press Numpad 1 to take one screenshot manually or Numpad 2 to activate automatic screenshots that will be taken every 30 metres.

5. Load p1.png - p50.png into Microsoft ICE.
